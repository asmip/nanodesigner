# nanodesigner

This is a legacy project written for the Java Monkey Engine 3 (JME3) environment. It requires JME3 to build and execute.

This project was developed for academic purposes.

This code is publically available, but there are absolutely no guarantees with it.

This program allows the creation of Protein Databank Files (*.pdb) which then inturn can be used in molecular dynamics simulations such as NAMD (Not Another Molecular Dynamics Program or now known as Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAMD.
